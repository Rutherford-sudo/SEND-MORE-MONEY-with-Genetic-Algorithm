# *SEND+MORE = MONEY*  with Genetic Algorithm

This code is based on the book **Classic Computer Science Problems In Python** by David Kopec

This code is an implementation of the solution to one of the most well-known CryptArithmetic problems through the use of a generic genetic algorithm.
Verbal arithmetic, also known as **alphametics**, **cryptarithmetic**, **cryptarithm** or **word addition**, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters.

It is not an efficient solution because genetic algorithms require greater processing capacity, the main idea here is to serve as a study only.
These algorithms have a stochastic nature, so each time they are executed, new results will appear
